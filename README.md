# 1721-Site

This repository hosts FRC-1721s website. All code for this site is written by
Brennan Macaig, excluding libraries such as bootflat, Bootstrap and jQuery.

Our code is protected by a [modified version of the MIT license](LICENSE.md), so
please read that before using this code.

As a general rule, you probably shouldn't use this code. I don't get along with
CSS and tend to break frameworks to do whatever I want without actually caring
about any consequences. You'll probably care about consequences though, so I
mean you should stay away from this stuff.
